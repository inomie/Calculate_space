# Calculate_space
The program will calculate the disc space of folders and files. To run the program (./mdu [-j] [number of threads] [file...][Folder...]) or (./mdu [file...][folder...]). The program will calculate how many blockes it will take on the disc. If the [-j] flag is uses it will calculate it faster, you will reach the fastest speed when the program use around [threads (7-8)].
